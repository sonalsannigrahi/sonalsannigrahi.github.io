          <h3 class="display-5">About</h3><hr>
          <p class="font-weight-light"> 
         I am a second year master's student at Saarland University studying <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/research.html"> Language Science and Technology </a> where I work at the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology">Multilingual Technologies Lab, DFKI </a> under the supervision of Dr. Cristina Espana-Bonet. Prior to this, I received my bachelor's as a Mathematics and Computer Science double major at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en"> Ã‰cole Polytechnique</a>. 
           <br><br>
           My current research interests largely revolve around learning better representations of languages (especially low-resource, multilingual, and those that promote fairness) as well as studying how language models really work. However, I am still discovering new things that motivate and inspire me so I'm always on the lookout for exciting research directions! My larger goal with all this is to make education and digital technologies as widely accessible as possible, by breaking down as many of the language barriers possible.

          My love for languages and inclusivity goes far beyond the realms of research and academic work! In my free time, I volunteer at a bunch of places whose mission I believe in! I am a proud contributor of all of these wonderful organisations :)

          Code.org allows tech enthusiats from around the world to register as a volunteer and teach basic programming skills to kids everywhere. One event I conducted was part of EU Code Week 2020 where I spoke about different scholarship opportunities available for women in STEM fields within the EMEA region.

          </li> 
          I joined RaspberryPi Translation in the summer of 2019 as a translator for the English-Hindi team. Here, I translated and reviewed numerous projects to impact more than 250 code clubs in India. I also succesfully organised a translation hackathon where we tranlslated 15 projects in 7 different languages! This work was highly impactful in rural communities throughout India. I would strongly recommend joining the translation team as they are super welcoming to new volunteers and the work is extremely rewarding!
