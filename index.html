          <p class="font-weight-light"> 
         I am a final year student following a Mathematics and Computer Science double major at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en"> École Polytechnique</a> within the Bachelor Programme. Having started coding only in 2018 as part of my introductory Python programming course, I would've never guessed how much I would have come around to loving computer science! With my background in mathematics, I quickly began to appreciate the problem solving component of Computer Science. However, something was still missing for me. 
           <br><br>
         In came my passion for languages! Combining linguistics, mathematics, and computer science seemed like an impossible task before I knew of the wonders of NLP. Growing up in India, I developed a quadrilingual background due to which I recognise the challenges that translation poses and more so the challenges it poses for complex languages such as those found in India. I am determined to make translation systems better for low resource languages and also improve current language modelling tools for South Asian languages.

           My current research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I hope to focus within the areas of multi-modal translations, with attention given to low resource languages. I am working on, and have worked on, some exciting projects! Here are my major contributions in fields ranging from biocomputing to my current interests in language technology.

Furthermore, I was tasked with building industrial level solutions which led me to study model compression via knowledge distillation.

Finally, I performed sentiment analysis on bilingual tweets using a Naïve Bayes classifier.

         I talk about what I think about the position of women in STEM fields, why I think representation matter, and what I'm doing to break down language barriers for people around the world with hopes of making tech an inclusive field!

          <h4>Tech Outreach</h4>
          My love for languages and inclusivity goes far beyond the realms of research and academic work! In my free time, I volunteer at a bunch of places whose mission I believe in! I am a proud contributor of all of these wonderful organisations :)
         <ul class="clist">
            <li> <span class="badge badge-secondary">2020</span>
          <a href="https://code.org/"> Code.org </a> 
          </li> 
          Code.org allows tech enthusiats from around the world to register as a volunteer and teach basic programming skills to kids everywhere. One event I conducted was part of EU Code Week 2020 where I spoke about different scholarship opportunities available for women in STEM fields within the EMEA region. 
            <li> <span class="badge badge-secondary">2019</span>
          <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/translate/"> RaspberryPi Translation Volunteer </a> 
          </li> 
          I joined RaspberryPi Translation in the summer of 2019 as a translator for the English-Hindi team. Here, I translated and reviewed numerous projects to impact more than 250 code clubs in India. I also succesfully organised a translation hackathon where we tranlslated 15 projects in 7 different languages! This work was highly impactful in rural communities throughout India. I would strongly recommend joining the translation team as they are super welcoming to new volunteers and the work is extremely rewarding!
